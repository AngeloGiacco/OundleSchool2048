# OundleSchool2048

The goal of this repository is to create a 2048 style game. 
It will go up to tile number 16384. 
Each tile number corresponds to a house at my current school. T
he website should display the score, level of the player and grid. 
For the actual game, tiles don't contain numbers but the name of the house they represent in that house's colour. 

It is made using p5.js and develops of a tutorial made by THE CODING TRAIN which can be found on youtube.
